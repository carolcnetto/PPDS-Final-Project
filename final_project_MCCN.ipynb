    "\n",
    "I am interested in finding out which genre is the most and the least successful over the years, which director produced the most profitable movies and the money-making decades. This is interesting because the Walt Disney Company was not focused in only one style, they produced a large variety of film genres. \n",
    "\n",
    "I would expect the genre of **Western** movies being the least popular and therefore the least profitable. The gem are probably the **Musicals**. Most likely the director that made more profit worked with Musicals. I am not sure about the money-making decades but I am excited to find out.\n",
